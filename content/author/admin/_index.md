I‘m a global change ecologist and currently doing my PhD at the Quantitative & Applied Ecology Group, a diverse and dynamic ecological modelling group at the University of Melbourne.

My research focus is on developing methods for integrated assessments of biodiversity change to improve our ability to forecast the fate of biodiversity under future scenarios. I’m particularly interested in understanding the importance of socioeconomic drivers and on capturing the impacts of global transitions by coupling models across scientific disciplines.

Besides my research, I’m passionate about LGBTIQ+ issues and mental health awareness.
