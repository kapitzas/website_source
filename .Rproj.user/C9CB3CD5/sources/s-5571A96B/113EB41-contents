```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I am regularly working with the WorldClim data set and in some cases had to download and merge the individual high res (0.5 arcmin) tiles for my work. To make things easier I made a little R package out of my workflow that does that really quickly and I will briefly discribe here with examples how it works. 

1. Download the package from GitHub:

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("kapitzas/WorldClimTiles")
```

2. Load the package and download a boundary file for France. France is a good example because it intersects with two WorldClim tiles.


```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
require("WorldClimTiles")
require("raster")

#Download polygon feature for France
fra <- getData("GADM", country = "FRA", level = 0)
```

3. Get the [WorldClim tile names](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/263414/acquiring-and-understanding-data-from-world-clim tiles) that are intersected by the boundary shape of France.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#Get WorldClim tile names 
tilenames <- tile_name(fra)
tilenames
```

4. Download the two tiles ("15", "16"). The default download path is the current working directory.

```{r, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#Download tiles
tiles <- tile_get(tilenames, "bio")
```

5. Merge the downloaded tiles layer by layer. The function produces a raster stack that contains the merged layers with the correct variable names.

```{r merging, eval=FALSE}
merged <- tile_merge(tiles)
```
